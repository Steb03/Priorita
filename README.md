# Priorita

Overkill todo list app that initially began to help me learn Vue. 

We are trying to make this the most feature-rich and overkill app the industry has to offer, since there are too many todo list apps anyway.

Feel free to join up and help out!

## To Set Up and Code the Project:

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

### Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

### Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).

### Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

#### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```
